This program reads a square matrix from the user, prints it, calculates and prints the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals, and checks if the matrix is a magic square. 
The code is organized into two classes: MagicSquare for the main logic and Square for the matrix operations.
It will first ask the user to enter an integer for the size of the square.
It will then ask the user in 9 separate inputs to enter integers for the square calculations.
